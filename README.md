# Learned Compression for Compressed Learning

This repository contains the code, experiments, and results accompanying the paper "Learned Compression for Compressed Learning"](https://danjacobellis.net/_static/walloc.pdf)

## Organization

`train`: Experiments and results for training compressed-domain image models (classification, colorization)

`train_audio`: Experiments and results for training audio models (music source separation)

`RD`: Evaluation of rate, distortion, perception, computation and dimension of various audio and image codecs

`FIC`: Experiments and results for full-input compression via pre-trained models (document understanding)
